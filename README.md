# SimpleApps

SimpleApps is a set of applications that implement architectures
using minimalist applications.

Architectures demonstrated:

* MVVM in a WPF appliation
* MVC in a WPF application
* MVC in a console application [TODO]

These are trivial applications for demonstration purposes yet they show
best known methods that may server as a basis for larger programs.
